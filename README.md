  storage_account_name = "stroageweatherapp"
  container_name       = "container1"
  key                  = "terraform.tfstate"
}
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ GitHub Actions Workflow
- The deploy.yml workflow:

- Runs terraform init, terraform validate, terraform plan, and terraform apply automatically on push to this branch.

- Deploys all resources to Azure.

- Ensures CI/CD integration for infrastructure provisioning.
